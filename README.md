# WizzairBestTrip
program has the following functionality: 
It retrieves existing fares from a travel website, selects the lowest prices among the given fares, as if looking for the best deals. It calculates the best interval for the return trip based on how long you want to stay at the destination. The program works on any request related to the travel site.

The second functionality is choosing fares based on the desired price.

The working principle of the program is as follows:
The program takes the following parameters to generate the best fares:
FROM = 'KUT' -- Departure location
TO = 'AUH' -- Destination location
INTERVAL = 7 -- Interval (the time between the departure date and the return date)
USER_PRICE = 123 -- Desired price for the fare

The result will be exported to an Excel file
